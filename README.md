# ScholarSync â€“ Resume & Google Scholar Integration App

ScholarSync is a Next.js-based full-stack web application that helps users parse resumes, scrape Google Scholar profiles, and receive intelligent project suggestions based on academic data. It uses Redux for state management and includes several middleware layers for security and performance.

## Features

- Resume upload and parsing
- Google Scholar scraping
- Project suggestion engine
- CSRF protection, CORS, and rate limiting
- Modular structure with reusable middleware
- State management via Redux Toolkit

## Middleware Usage

All API routes are secured with the following middlewares:

- **CORS**: Restricts access to specific origins (`lib/middleware/cors.js`)
- **CSRF Protection**: Mitigates cross-site request forgery (`lib/middleware/csrf.js`)
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute-force and abuse (`lib/middleware/rateLimit.js`)
- **File Validation**: Ensures uploaded files are of valid type/size (`lib/middleware/validateFile.js`)
